## Overview

This repository contains a set of console-based programs written in C and C++. Each program serves as a hands-on exercise for practicing different programming topics:

- Arithmetic operations  
- Matrix manipulation and calculations  
- Prime number utilities  
- String/permutation logic  
- Trigonometric calculations  

Feel free to explore, compile, and modify the code as a learning experience—or use them as a starting point for more advanced projects!

## Build & Run Instructions

Compile and run each program using `gcc` (for C) or `g++` (for C++). Replace `<filename>` with the actual source file name.

```bash
# Compile
gcc matrix.c -o matrix
g++ calculator.cpp -o calculator

# Run
./matrix
./calculator
